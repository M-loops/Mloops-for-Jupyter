# Installing The Mloops Jupyter Notebook Extensions
Jupyter Notebook is a powerful open-source tool for data science and scientific computing. One of its great features is the ability to extend its functionality through the use of extensions. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Jupyter Notebook extensions on your system.

## Prerequisites and Requirements 
Before proceeding, you should make sure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can download and install it by following the instructions on the official Jupyter Notebook website: https://jupyter.org/install.

Other Requirements - python libraries:
- pyodbc
- pandas
- json
- numpy
- random

## Installing an Extension
To install a Jupyter Notebook extension, you can use either the conda package manager or pip package manager. The conda command is recommended if you installed Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda or Miniconda, while the pip command is recommended for other installations.

Open a command prompt or terminal window.

Identify the extension you want to install. You can find a list of extensions on the Jupyter Notebook extensions website or through a search engine.

Install the extension using either conda or pip. For example, to install the Table of Contents (TOC) extension using conda, you can run the following command:

conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

If you prefer to use pip, you can run:

pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions

After the installation is complete, you need to enable the extension in Jupyter Notebook. To do this, launch Jupyter Notebook by typing jupyter notebook in a command prompt or terminal window.

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click on the Nbextensions tab, which should be located on the upper-right corner of the interface.

In the Nbextensions tab, you should see a list of available extensions. Find the extension you installed in step 3 and click on the checkbox next to it to enable it.

Finally, click the Save button at the bottom of the Nbextensions tab to save your changes. The extension should now be installed and enabled in your Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully installed a Jupyter Notebook extension. Extensions can greatly enhance your productivity and make your data science workflow more efficient. If you encounter any issues, make sure to consult the extension's documentation or seek help from the community.
